			Nahargarh Fort stands on the edge of the Aravalli Hills, overlooking the pink city of Jaipur in the Indian 
			state of Rajasthan. The view of the city from the fort is impressive.
			Along with Amer Fort and Jaigarh Fort, Nahargarh once formed a strong defence ring for the city. The fort 
			was originally named Sudarshangarh, but it became known as Nahargarh, which means 'abode of tigers'. 
			The popular belief is that Nahar here stands for Nahar Singh Bhomia, whose spirit haunted the place and 
			obstructed construction of the fort. Nahar's spirit was pacified by building a temple in his memory within 
			the fort, which thus became known by his name.
			Built mainly in 1734 by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II, the founder of Jaipur, the fort was constructed as a 
			place of retreat on the summit of the ridge above the city. Walls extended over the surrounding hills, 
			forming fortifications that connected this fort to Jaigarh, the fort above the old capital of Amber. Though 
			the fort never came under attack during the course of its history, it did see some historical events, notably 
			the treaties with the Maratha forces who warred with Jaipur in the 18th century. During the Indian Mutiny of 
			1857, the Europeans of the region, including the British Resident's wife, were moved to Nahargarh fort by the 
			king of Jaipur, Sawai Ram Singh, for their protection.
			The fort was extended in 1868 during the reign of Sawai Ram Singh. In 1883-92, a range of palaces was built at 
			Nahargarh by Sawai Madho Singh at a cost of nearly three and a half lakh rupees. The Madhavendra Bhawan, built 
			by Sawai Madho Singh had suites for the queens of Jaipur and at the head was a suite for the king himself. The 
			rooms are linked by corridors and still have some delicate frescos. Nahargarh was also a hunting residence of the Maharajas.
			Until April 1944, the Jaipur State government used for its official purposes solar time read from the Samrat Yantra 
			in the Jantar Mantar Observatory, with a gun fired from Nahargarh Fort as the time signal.
