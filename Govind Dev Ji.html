			The Hindu temple Govind Dev Ji is situated in Jaipur in Rajasthan state of India. It is located in 
			the City Palace complex. The temple is dedicated to Govind Dev Ji (Lord Krishna).This temple is among 
			the 7 temples of Thakur of Vrindavan including Sri Radhavallabh ji, Shri Bankey Bihari Ji, Shri Govind 
			Dev Ji and four others. The image of the deity (murti) was brought from Vrindavan here by Raja Sawai 
			Jai Singh II, the founder of Jaipur. According to popular legend, Lord Krishna's image in the temple 
			looks exactly like Krishna's form during his incarnation on Earth.
			The deity originally belonged to Srila Rupa Goswami who was a disciple of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu.
			According to the legend, the Image of Lord Govind Devji was also called "Bajrakrit"- indicating thereby 
			that it was created by Bajranabh â€“ The Great Grand Son of Lord Krishna. Some 5,000 years back when Shri 
			Bajranabh was around 13 years old, he asked his Grand Mother (daughter-in-law of Lord Krishna) as to how 
			Lord Shri Krishna looked like; Then He made an image as per the description given by her. She however, 
			said that not all but the feet of that image looked like those of Lord Shri Krishna. He made another image, 
			yet she said that the Chest looked like that of Lord Shri Krishna. Thereafter, He made the Third Image and 
			looking at the same she veiled her face as a show of modesty, and remarked that the image was an exact likeness of Krishna.
			The first one came to be known as <b>Madan Mohanji</b>. The second one was called as Lord <b>GOPI NATHJI</b> and the Third One, 
			the likeness of Krishna is LORD <b>GOVIND DEVJI</b>. With passing of ages the glories of the Indian Culture were being forgotten 
			and the sands of time kept piling up. Together with every other thing these pious divine images were also lost from the memories 
			of people. Some 500 years ago, legend has it that Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu asked one of his disciples to excavate the idol 
			of Govinda, which had been buried there to protect it from the Mughal marauders.
			For Vaishnavites, particularly followers of Lord Krishna, this is one of the most important temples outside Vrindavan.
			'Aartis' and 'Bhog' are offered seven times a day, when the deity is unveiled for 'Darshan'. Thousands of devotees visit the temple daily and an even larger number visit during Janmashtami.
